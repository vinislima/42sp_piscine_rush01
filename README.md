# RUSH 01

Rush 01 challenges students to solve a grid-based logic puzzle, requiring them to arrange numbers in a 4x4 grid while respecting visibility constraints from all directions. The project combines foundational programming skills, such as input parsing and error handling, with intermediate logic and problem-solving techniques. It provides hands-on experience with memory management and highlights the importance of writing clean, efficient code within strict norms.

Despite the effort invested, we were unable to deliver a fully functional program. However, the process allowed us to explore and understand various new concepts in programming. The project was submitted in compliance with the 42 norms and successfully compiled, demonstrating a solid grasp of the required coding standards. As the implementation was incomplete, the code lacks comments and cannot be effectively utilised, reflecting the challenges faced during development.

Through this project, students learn to process structured input, validate data, and apply logical deductions to meet specific constraints. They gain a deeper understanding of how to handle invalid inputs gracefully and produce meaningful error messages when no valid solutions exist. The task also emphasises the careful use of dynamic memory, ensuring all allocated resources are properly freed to avoid leaks.

Rush 01 reinforces teamwork and collaboration, as each team member must be fully familiar with the solution and able to explain their work during evaluations. By completing this project, students build a strong foundation in logic, memory management, and structured problem-solving, preparing them for more advanced algorithmic challenges in future projects.
